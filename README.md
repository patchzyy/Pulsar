# Retro Rewind

Retro Rewind is a custom track distribution created by ZPL.

# Pulsar

Pulsar is a Mario Kart Wii Kamek-Based engine to create CT distributions. It comes with its own [software](../main/PulsarPackCreator/Executable) to aid in building custom distributions, and multiple quality of life features:

Core:
- Cup select expansion
- Settings that are directly modifiable in-game, including in friend rooms
- Up to four time-trial modes (150cc, 150cc feather, 200cc and 200cc feather)
- Ghost saving on all tracks and all four modes (on the SD on console and on the NAND on dolphin)
- Support for staff ghosts should the creator make them
- KO mode
- OnlineTT mode
- LEX support
- [XPF support](https://github.com/Gabriela-Orzechowska/LE-CODE-XPF) (from Gabriela)
- [USB GCN Support](https://github.com/Gabriela-Orzechowska/MKW-Cosmos/blob/main/code/System/WUP028.hpp) (from Gabriela)


UI:
- A speedometer that is flush with the game UI
- In-game crediting of track authors
- Between Races Change Combo, which has its own UI along with a randomize button
- Team selection, where the host of a room can manually set the team of each player. Moreover, team VS has been edited to play exactly as normal VS while keeping the coloured minimap icons and the scoreboard after races.
- Boot in wiimmfi directly
- Better ghost replay which allows multi ghost watching and point-of-view switching


Sound:
- BRSAR entry size patch to make all brstms loop normally
- Conditionnal channel switches; the game will only switch channel (on Koopa Cape for example) if the currently playing brstm has at least as many channels as the brsar entry requires.
- BRSTM Volume, much like it works in CTGP by editing byte 0x3F of any BRSTM
- BRSTM expansion
- Optional Music speedUp on final lap (the music is sped up when you cross the line instead of switching to the fast lap version)


Gameplay:
- 200cc support
- Ultra Mini-Turbos
- Mega TCs
- CLF78 and stebler's feather
- Support for custom CC distribution
- COOB (both kHacker35000vr's and Riidefi's versions)


Network:
- Rooms that can only be joined by people on the same pack (including the same version)
- A much faster Host Always Wins where the host selects the next track directly in the race.
- Worldwides that work as on vanilla
- The features that impact gameplay the most (200cc, UMTs, feather, mega TCs) can be turned off in the software when making your distribution. Pulsar can also be used as a base to add your own features. CTTP is such an example. The software only outputs the tracks and a config file, but the code binaries can be modified to fit your needs.
